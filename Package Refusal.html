<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We strongly discourage our customers from refusing packages, as it will cost more money in the long run. When a package is refused, the shipping carrier will charge for the return shipping cost, which we in turn must deduct from your refund. Instead, we recommend accepting the package, and contact us to start a return.<br>
<br>
For international orders, please be aware that refusing the package does not eliminate the brokerage fee that the shipping carrier charges. If an international customer does refuse the package, they will be refunded less shipping &amp; handling (both ways), and the amount of the brokerage fee once we get the package back (if applied).</span></p>
